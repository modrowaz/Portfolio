# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a combination of independent code samples and analytics team projects that I have worked on in the past year that highlight some of my experiences with various analytics tools.

You will find a variety of PowerBI files that contain analysis of simulated data in the form of DAX queries to develop appropriate calculated columns or measures to be displayed as a table or in a dashboard, dashboards that perform business intelligence functions, and relational database development.

Various codebooks in R and Python languages are also included to display data manipulation, data pre-processing, feature engineering, data visualization, modeling, and web scraping techniques used throughout projects.

Three major analytics projects are presented with accompanying presentations and whitepapers to delineate all steps of analysis. Tableau dashboards and stories are included with many of these projects to provide clients with interactive tools. 

I hope you find these resources to be appropriate displays of my skill set, and please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out for more code samples or demonstrations of proficiencies.
